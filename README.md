Hello, 


Welcome to our GitHub repository. We are members of the reactors physics laboratory at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ/COPPE) and this is our modifications in the nuclear data processing code called FRENDY, developed by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA). Our primary goal is to generate deformed neutron cross-sections using the Kaniadakis statistics.


In order to TEST these files it is mandatory to install the FRENDY code in your machine. The following websites explains how to do that:
https://rpg.jaea.go.jp/main/en/program_frendy/

These are the files that will be modified inside FRENDY
in order to calculating deformed cross-sections using the Kaniadakis distribution

Utilized folders inside FRENDY:

frendy_XXXXXXXX\tests\ReconResonance (File ....test.cpp)

frendy_XXXXXXXX\frendy\ReconResonance (Files .cpp and .hpp)

Folder to see the results files:

frendy_XXXXXXXX\tests\ReconResonance\comp_njoy

Folder to start the compilation (Windows, via 'wsl' command):

frendy_XXXXXXXX\tests\ReconResonance
